# E-Commerce Back End

## Description

The motivation of this challenge is to build the back end for an e-commerce site. In this project we configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. I learned how to create CRUD routes that are connected with keys in order to create, update, view and delete different retail features for an e-commerce platform.
